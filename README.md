# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data

This repository contains the files for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment as follows:

- CodeBook.md: Describes the way that the data was extracted and manipulated to produce the resulting tidy data set.  It includes an explanation of the variables in the tidy data set.
- run_analysis.R: A script to execute the entire analysis including the export of a csv file, tidy_data.csv.
- tidy_data.csv: The file exported by the run_analysis.R script which includes the data summarised as per the assignment description.  (Note that the data file uploaded for the assignment submission was a text file generated via write.table(). The csv file was created before the instruction to create a text file was read.)
